# KhulnaSoft's "Dotfiles"

**Hey, there!**

**I’m KhulnaSoft, and I’m passionate about creating educational tech content for IT Pros and Homelab nerds.**

This Repository **Dotfiles** contain my personal config files. Here you'll find configs, customizations, themes, and whatever I need to personalize my mac OS experience.

> :warning: Be aware, products can change over time. I do my best to keep up with the latest changes and releases, but please understand that this won’t always be the case.

## Terminal and Application Icons with Nerd-Fonts

To display icons in terminal or applications Fonts, I'm using [Nerd-Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com). I'm currently using the **Hack Nerd Font Mono** in terminal applications, and **Hack Nerd Font** in applications.
